                        <p>As Enroll America's digital producer, I was responsible for major functionality and UI/UX upgrades to this consumer scheduling and healthcare enrollment data reporting tool (which is also available in a <a href="http://www.coverks.org/connector" target="blank">white-label</a> version or as a <a href="https://plannedparenthoodhealthinsurancefacts.org/get-help/help-enrolling/" target="blank">custom interface</a>). The Connector is now maintained by our friends at Young Invincibles; try it yourself below.</p>
                        <div><script src="https://connector.getcoveredamerica.org/static/js/widget.js" width="650px" data-language="en-us" id="gca-connector-embed"></script></div>

                    	<h2 id="T2"><strong>Get Covered Plan Explorer</strong></a></h2>
                        <p>I started at Enroll America just days before the Plan Explorer went live, at the start of the annual open enrollment period, so got to know it intimately through trial by fire. The Plan Explorer was a decision-support tool that allowed consumers to make apples-to-apples comparisons between different health plans in the federal marketplace in a significantly more streamlined manner than HealthCare.gov, and provided personalized cost estimates based on each household's unique health situation. Enroll took the tool offline this summer (it is unfortunately unavailable via the Internet Archive because the front end was designed as a JavaScript-based widget, like the Connector above), but you can navigate through screenshots of its views below.</p>

This project is the one on which I became a believer in product ownership.</p>
